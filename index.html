        <h1>ABC Glossary Questionnaire</h1>
        <p>this questionnaire is a tool for reflection and sourcing as part of a glossary for an anti-colonial Black feminist critical media ecology — or abc glossary for short. abc glossary calls for a more embodied relationship between our technological infrastructure, nature, and ourselves through an understanding and reevaluation of the language that mediates these interactions. this questionnaire is a means to collectively uncover and remember in the midst of ongoing electronic settler colonialism that posits these terms as neutral, and to imagine and redefine new terms & conditions. </p>
